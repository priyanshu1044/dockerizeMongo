# Docker Quick Start Guide 🚀

Welcome to the Docker Quick Start Guide! This README.md will help you understand the basics of Docker, including essential commands and concepts, to get you up and running quickly.

## Docker Components 🐳

### Docker Engine
The core of Docker, allowing you to create and run containers.

### Docker CLI - Command Line Interface 💻
The command-line tool to interact with Docker.

### Docker Registry 📦
A storage and distribution system for Docker images. The most commonly used registry is Docker Hub.

## Images vs Containers 📦➡️🛳️

### Docker Image
A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

### Docker Container
A container is a running instance of an image. It encapsulates the application or service and its dependencies, running in an isolated environment.

## Common Docker Commands 🛠️

- **List images**: `docker images`
- **List running containers**: `docker ps`
- **Run a container**: `docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]`
- **Build an image**: `docker build -t image_name .`

## Dockerfile 📝

A Dockerfile is a script containing a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image. Here are some common Dockerfile commands:

- **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory for any `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY` instructions that follow it.
- **RUN**: Executes any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the results.
- **CMD**: Provides defaults for executing a container. There can only be one `CMD` instruction in a Dockerfile.
- **EXPOSE**: Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.
- **ENV**: Sets environment variables.
- **COPY**: Copies files from the Docker host to the Docker image.

### Example Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:20

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package* .

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the files
COPY . .

# Build the project
RUN npm run build

# Expose port 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

## Building Images 🏗️

To build a Docker image from a Dockerfile, use:

```bash
docker build -t image_name .
```

## Running Images 🏃‍♂️

To run a Docker image as a container, use:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 image_name
```

### Passing Environment Variables 🌐

You can pass environment variables to a container using the `-e` flag:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -e ENV_VAR_NAME=value image_name
```

## Managing Containers 🛠️

- **Kill a container**: `docker kill container_id`
- **Execute a command inside a container**: `docker exec -it container_id command`

## Additional Concepts 🌟

### Layers
Docker images are made up of layers. Each instruction in a Dockerfile adds a new layer to the image.

### Volumes 📂

Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. To create and use a volume, follow these steps:

1. **Create a volume**:

    ```bash
    docker volume create my_volume
    ```

2. **Run a container with a volume**:

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v my_volume:/path/in/container image_name
    ```

### Bind Mounts 🗂️

Bind mounts allow you to mount a file or directory from your host machine into a container. This can be useful for development when you want the container to use the latest code from your host. (Ex. NextJS app hot reloading)

1. **Run a container with a bind mount**:

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v /path/on/host:/path/in/container image_name
    ```

    - `/path/on/host`: Path to the file or directory on your host machine.
    - `/path/in/container`: Path where the file or directory will be mounted inside the container.

### Network 🌐

Docker networking allows containers to communicate with each other and with other non-Docker workloads. To create and use a network, follow these steps:

1. **Create a network**:

    ```bash
    docker network create my_network
    ```

2. **Run a container and connect it to the network**:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --network my_network image_name
    ```

### Docker Compose 📜

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. A `docker-compose.yml` file allows you to configure your application’s services, networks, and volumes.

### Example `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mongodb:
    image: "mongo"
    container_name: mongodb
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - "mongodb_data:/data/db"
  backend:
    image: "backend22"
    container_name: backend_application
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      MONGO_URL: "mongodb://mongodb:27017/test"

volumes:
  mongodb_data:
```
